          <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>

            <li>Scheduled AI-generated phone calls to Call Recipients</li>
            <li>Personalized conversation based on preferences, interests, and reminders configured by the Subscriber</li>
            <li>Post-call summaries and transcripts delivered to the Subscriber</li>
            <li>Missed call alerts and call history</li>
            <li>A preview phone line for prospective users to experience a sample call without an account</li>
          </ul>
          <div className="legal-page__notice">
            <strong>Important:</strong> Donna is not a medical device, emergency service, or substitute for professional healthcare. Donna does not provide medical advice, diagnose conditions, or monitor health. If the Call Recipient experiences a medical emergency, call 911 or your local emergency number.

            <li>You have the legal authority to agree to these Terms</li>
            <li>You have obtained appropriate consent from the Call Recipient (or their legal guardian or authorized representative) to receive AI-generated phone calls from Donna</li>

            <li>You have the legal authority to provide this consent on behalf of the Call Recipient</li>
            <li>You will promptly notify Donna if the Call Recipient revokes their consent or requests that calls cease</li>
          </ol>
          <p>You agree to indemnify and hold Donna harmless from any claims, damages, or penalties arising from your failure to obtain proper consent.
