              We&apos;re Nick &amp; David, the founders of Donna. We built Donna because we know
              firsthand how hard it is to make sure nothing slips through the cracks when
              you&apos;re helping take care of an aging loved one. Primary caregivers have so
              much on their plates — booking and driving their loved one to appointments,
              managing their paperwork and finances, decluttering their houses — all while
              trying to keep up their core relationship with their loved one. Not a
              relationship as a chauffeur or accountant or maid or all of the above. But as
              a child, a spouse, or other family member or dear friend.
            </p>
            <p className="about__text">
              With all those big responsibilities, we&apos;ve seen how smaller things get missed.
              Maybe the plants don&apos;t get watered, maybe a favorite sports team&apos;s game
              doesn&apos;t get watched, maybe the doors don&apos;t get locked at night. We built Donna
              to help. Donna can never replace your efforts as a caregiver, and Donna can
              certainly never replace your core relationship. But for many families already,
              Donna serves as a helpful assistant that gives your loved one an extra layer of
              support and care.

              <p>
                Nick&apos;s grandpa is an avid Detroit Tigers baseball fan. They play 162 games
                per year, and if anyone has time to watch them all, it&apos;s him. However, game
                times vary by day and he often used to miss them. But Donna never misses them.
                Now he gets a call 10 minutes before every Tigers game starts — so he
                hasn&apos;t missed a pitch since.
