# Voice Pipeline Important TODOs

Captured after the April 14, 2026 voice pipeline audit. The timezone fallback bug was fixed separately; the remaining items below should be treated as prioritized follow-up work.

## Implementation Status

Fixed on branch `codex/voice-pipeline-todos`:

- Inactive senior phone matches now take a no-PHI hangup path.
- Manual and welfare outbound calls are hydrated in Pipecat, so they no longer depend on Node process memory.
- Reminder acknowledgments keep the low-latency async DB write, but post-call waits briefly and re-reads delivery status before retry decisions.
- WebSocket start-frame auth now happens before consuming an active-call slot, with a short handshake timeout.
- Caregiver notes are marked delivered only after assistant transcript evidence.
- Caregiver notification triggers now raise on non-2xx responses and high-severity concerns send Node's expected `data.concern` string.
- Assistant transcript tracking now receives guidance-stripped text.
- Gemini Live now schedules and awaits post-call processing on both disconnect and normal pipeline end.
- General in-call web search no longer caches arbitrary live-query results.
- Node-scheduled reminder calls now include a reminder call hint, and Pipecat waits briefly for the `reminder_deliveries.call_sid` row before falling back to generic outbound handling.

## High Priority

### 1. Block inactive senior matches in Pipecat phone lookup

- **Status**: Fixed. `find_by_phone()` is active-only by default; inactive matches return safe hangup TwiML without loading senior context or creating a conversation.
- **Why it matters**: `pipecat/services/seniors.py::find_by_phone()` returns seniors by phone regardless of `is_active`. `pipecat/api/routes/voice.py` then treats any match as a real senior and can load PHI context.
- **Risk**: A deactivated or soft-deleted senior can still be recognized on inbound calls and get conversation records/context.
- **Fix direction**: Make phone lookup active-only by default, add an explicit inactive lookup only where needed, and have `/voice/answer` take a no-PHI path for inactive matches.

### 2. Persist Node-created outbound call context across the Node to Pipecat boundary

- **Status**: Fixed by Pipecat-side hydration. Redis reminder context remains in place; generic manual/welfare outbound calls hydrate memory, snapshot, notes, news, greeting, and settings inside `/voice/answer`.
- **Why it matters**: Node creates manual and welfare calls, then stores prefetch context only in local Maps. Twilio answers on Pipecat, which cannot read Node process memory.
- **Risk**: Manual/welfare calls can start without the memory context, snapshot, caregiver notes, news, greeting, and call settings that Node just prepared.
- **Fix direction**: Either hydrate full context in Pipecat for every known outbound senior, or persist Node prefetch by `CallSid` in shared Redis/DB and have Pipecat consume it.

### 3. Make reminder acknowledgment persistence reliable

- **Status**: Fixed with async write plus post-call verification. The tool still returns immediately, but post-call waits briefly for the ack task and re-reads `reminder_deliveries.status`; local `reminders_delivered` no longer suppresses retry cleanup by itself.
- **Why it matters**: The reminder tool marks local `reminders_delivered` before the DB update completes, then post-call skips retry cleanup when that local set is non-empty.
- **Risk**: If the DB acknowledgement write fails, a medication reminder may remain `delivered` rather than `acknowledged` or `retry_pending`.
- **Fix direction**: Track DB ack success, await the ack write in the tool, or have post-call re-read `reminder_deliveries.status` before deciding no retry is needed.

### 4. Authenticate WebSockets before consuming active-call capacity

- **Status**: Fixed. The Twilio start frame and `ws_token` are validated before semaphore acquisition; token consumption happens only after capacity is reserved.
- **Why it matters**: `/ws` accepts a WebSocket and consumes the call semaphore before the Twilio start frame is parsed and the `ws_token` is validated.
- **Risk**: A client can connect and stall before auth, tying up active-call capacity without starting AI services.
- **Fix direction**: Add a short handshake/auth timeout and only count calls as active after the Twilio start frame is received and the token validates.

### 4.5. Avoid the Node reminder delivery row race

- **Status**: Fixed. Node and Pipecat reminder schedulers tag Twilio answer URLs with `call_type=reminder`; Pipecat uses that tag to retry the DB lookup briefly before treating the call as generic outbound.
- **Why it matters**: Twilio can request `/voice/answer` before Node has committed the `reminder_deliveries` row containing the new `call_sid`.
- **Risk**: A medication or appointment reminder can hydrate as a generic outbound check-in and skip the reminder prompt/acknowledgment tracking.
- **Fix direction**: Keep the retry path scoped to tagged reminder calls so manual and welfare calls do not pay the delay.

## Medium Priority

### 5. Mark caregiver notes delivered only after actual delivery

- **Status**: Fixed conservatively. Notes are marked delivered post-call only when Donna's assistant transcript contains enough matching content. Uncertain delivery remains undelivered so it can be retried later.
- **Why it matters**: Caregiver notes are marked delivered on client connect, while the prompt only asks Donna to share them naturally.
- **Risk**: A note can be marked delivered even if Donna never says it.
- **Fix direction**: Mark notes delivered based on explicit delivery evidence, transcript confirmation, or a dedicated delivery tool/event.

### 6. Harden caregiver notification delivery and concern payload shape

- **Status**: Fixed. Notification POSTs now call `raise_for_status()` and concern alerts send `data.concern` plus structured metadata.
- **Why it matters**: Pipecat posts caregiver notifications without checking non-2xx HTTP status. High-severity concern notifications send the raw concern object, while Node expects `data.concern`.
- **Risk**: Bad API keys, validation errors, or server errors can silently drop caregiver alerts; concern alerts can send generic text instead of the real concern summary.
- **Fix direction**: Call `response.raise_for_status()`, log response status safely, retry if appropriate, and send a privacy-safe `concern` string in the shape Node expects.

### 7. Store only guidance-stripped assistant transcript text

- **Status**: Fixed. `GuidanceStripperProcessor` now runs before assistant transcript tracking.
- **Why it matters**: The pipeline records assistant text before `GuidanceStripperProcessor` removes internal guidance/bracketed directives.
- **Risk**: Internal tags or model-spoken guidance can be persisted in encrypted transcripts and post-call analysis input.
- **Fix direction**: Move assistant transcript tracking after guidance stripping or apply the same stripping before recording assistant turns.

### 8. Mirror Claude post-call lifecycle in Gemini Live

- **Status**: Fixed. Gemini Live now uses a start-once post-call task and awaits it after pipeline end.
- **Why it matters**: The Claude path starts post-call once and awaits it after pipeline end. The Gemini Live path only starts post-call on client disconnect and does not await/track it.
- **Risk**: Gemini calls ended by the `end_call` tool may skip post-call processing.
- **Fix direction**: Reuse the Claude `_start_post_call_once` pattern for Gemini Live and ensure post-call runs on both disconnect and normal pipeline end.

## Lower Priority

### 9. Remove general live web-search result caching

- **Status**: Fixed. Daily senior-interest news caching remains; arbitrary `web_search_query()` results are no longer cached.
- **Why it matters**: The learnings doc says general web-search caching was removed, but `pipecat/services/news.py::web_search_query()` still caches arbitrary live-query results for one hour.
- **Risk**: A stale or wrong result can be reused for later questions.
- **Fix direction**: Keep daily senior-interest news caching, but remove or sharply limit general in-call web-search result caching. In-flight dedup is safer than reuse.
