  {
    q: 'What is Donna?',
    a: "Donna is an AI assistant that calls your elderly loved ones as often as you choose. She has warm, natural conversations, delivers reminders, and sends you a summary after every call \u2014 so you always know your parent is okay.",
  },
  {
    q: 'Does Donna sound like a robot?',
    a: "Not at all. Donna uses advanced voice AI that sounds natural and warm. She listens, responds thoughtfully, remembers past conversations, and gets more familiar over time. Most people find her easy and enjoyable to talk to.",
  },
  {
    q: 'What if my parent doesn\'t pick up?',
    a: "If your parent doesn\u2019t pick up, Donna will notify you in the app that the call was missed. You can redial them on Donna\u2019s behalf, and they are also able to call Donna directly. If you don\u2019t want notifications for missed calls, you can disable them in the \u2018Settings\u2019 tab under \u2018Preferences\u2019.",
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I cancel anytime?',
    a: 'Yes, absolutely. There are no contracts or commitments. You can cancel anytime directly from the app.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What does a typical call look like?',
    a: "Calls typically last 1 to 15 minutes. Donna checks in on how they\u2019re feeling, chats about their interests and daily life, delivers any reminders you\u2019ve set, and wraps up warmly. Afterwards, a summary appears in your app. Some seniors just like to get quick reminders and/or answer Donna so that their family knows they\u2019re doing alright \u2013 others love to chat for hours a week and find it far more fun than watching TV or just sitting around. There\u2019s no right way to use Donna!",
  },
  {
    q: 'How soon can calls start after I download the app?',
    a: "Within minutes of completing setup. You enter your loved one's name, phone number, interests, and preferred call time — and Donna starts calling on the schedule you choose.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is my loved one's information kept private?",
    a: 'We encrypt sensitive information and do not sell personal data. We use service providers only as needed to operate Donna. You can review the privacy policy and third-party services pages at the bottom of this page.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Should I let my parent know I\'m getting Donna for them?',
    a: "Certainly! How would you feel if someone called unannounced and was trying to remind you what to do today \u{1F609}.",
  },
  {
    q: 'What\'s the best way to use Donna?',
    a: "Every family likes to use Donna slightly differently. Some really focus on using it as a tool to give reminders and keep their parent on top of important things. Some treat it like getting a \u2018Siri\u2019 or \u2018Alexa\u2019 their parent can call whenever they like to learn things on the internet. Some seniors like it for companionship. Some seniors enjoy it as entertainment and brain exercise, having fun conversations with an advanced technology made approachable. Some families just want their parent to answer Donna\u2019s call daily to quickly check in and confirm they\u2019re alright. And many early testers have found other exciting ways to get value out of Donna we\u2019d never even conceived of.\n\nThe only right way to use Donna is however it best serves you and your loved one.",
  },
  {
    q: 'My parent is \'tech-challenged\', will this be too complicated?',
    a: "If your parent can answer a phone call, then no! We intentionally designed Donna this way because we want seniors \u2013 those great with technology, those who are curious about technology, and those who don\u2019t even know what an \u2018app\u2019 is \u2013 to all be able to enjoy Donna.\n\nAnd Donna is simple for you, too \u2013 you can manage signup, call times, reminders, etc. all from our mobile app.",
  },
  {
    q: 'How is Donna different from a medical alert system?',
    a: "Medical alert systems react to emergencies. Donna\u2019s purpose is to proactively improve your loved one\u2019s daily life. Medical alert systems solve for things like falls and chest pains. Donna solves for things like forgetfulness, loneliness, boredom, and unanswered curiosities. Both serve distinct, important roles in the caregiving process.",
