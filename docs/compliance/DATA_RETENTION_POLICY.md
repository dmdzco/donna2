## Purpose

This policy establishes retention periods for all data categories in the Donna system, balancing:

1. **Care continuity** -- retaining enough data for Donna to provide meaningful, personalized calls
2. **Compliance** -- meeting HIPAA retention requirements (6 years for policies/procedures; state laws may require longer for clinical records)
3. **Privacy** -- minimizing the amount of PHI stored at any time (data minimization principle)
4. **Operational needs** -- maintaining data needed for system monitoring, quality improvement, and debugging

HIPAA does not prescribe specific retention periods for PHI itself, but requires that **policies and procedures** (including this document) and **documentation of compliance actions** be retained for 6 years. State laws vary -- some require medical records be retained for 7-10 years. This policy uses conservative retention periods that can be shortened once legal review confirms minimum requirements.

---

## Scope

This policy applies to all data stored in:
- **Neon PostgreSQL database** (all environments: production, staging, dev)
- **Application logs** (Railway, Sentry)
- **Third-party vendor systems** (Twilio, Anthropic, Deepgram, etc. -- see [Vendor Data Retention](#third-party-vendor-data-retention))
- **Developer machines** (if any PHI is present locally)
- **Backups** (Neon point-in-time recovery)

## Retention Period Justifications

### Conversations (1 year transcript, 3 years metadata)

- **Transcript and summary (1 year)**: Conversation content is the most sensitive PHI. One year provides adequate time for quality review, dispute resolution, and caregiver inquiries about past calls. New transcript writes use encrypted-only fields (`transcript_encrypted`, `transcript_text_encrypted`) and summary writes prefer `summary_encrypted`; legacy plaintext columns are read fallbacks for existing rows during migration. After 1 year, transcript and summary fields are NULLed but metadata (date, duration, sentiment) is retained for longitudinal analysis.
- **Caregiver call summaries**: Caregiver-facing APIs decrypt summaries server-side only after authentication and per-senior authorization, then return summary-only call records. Transcript fields and encryption keys are not returned to caregiver clients.
- **Metadata (3 years)**: Non-PHI call metadata (when calls happened, duration, sentiment score) supports operational analytics and care pattern tracking without retaining sensitive content.

### Memories (2 years)

- Semantic memories are the foundation of Donna's personalization. They contain facts about a senior's life, preferences, and health that enable meaningful conversations across calls.
- Two years balances personalization value against data minimization. Memories older than 2 years are unlikely to be relevant (interests change, health conditions evolve).
- Memory decay (existing feature) naturally reduces the retrieval score of older memories, making them less likely to surface in conversations before the hard purge.

### Call Analyses (1 year)

- Post-call analyses detect health concerns and track engagement over time. One year of analysis history is sufficient for identifying trends and patterns.
- After 1 year, the raw analysis data is no longer actionable and should be purged.

### Daily Call Context (90 days)

- Daily context is operational data used for same-day cross-call continuity. It has no long-term value.
- 90 days provides a safety margin for debugging and operational review.

### Reminder Deliveries (90 days)

- Delivery tracking records (when a reminder was delivered, whether acknowledged) are operational.
- 90 days is sufficient for debugging delivery failures and reviewing adherence patterns.

### Audit Logs (6 years)

- HIPAA requires that compliance documentation, including audit trails, be retained for 6 years from the date of creation or the date when the document was last in effect, whichever is later (45 CFR 164.530(j)).
- This is a legal minimum, not a recommendation. Some organizations retain audit logs for 7-10 years.

### Senior Profiles (active + 1 year)

- Senior profiles are retained as long as the senior is active (receiving calls).
- After the last call, a 1-year grace period allows for service resumption without data loss.
- After 1 year of inactivity, a manual review determines whether to purge or extend (e.g., if a caregiver requests continued retention).

## Automated Purge Implementation

### Architecture

Implement a scheduled purge job that runs daily during off-peak hours (e.g., 3:00 AM UTC). The job should:

1. Query for records past their retention period
2. Log what will be purged (counts, not content) to the audit log
3. Execute deletions in batches to avoid database performance impact
4. Report results (records purged per table)

### Recommended Implementation

```sql
-- Example: Purge conversation transcripts older than 1 year
-- Phase 1: NULL out PHI fields (retain metadata)
UPDATE conversations
SET transcript = NULL,
    transcript_encrypted = NULL,
    transcript_text_encrypted = NULL,
    summary = NULL,
    summary_encrypted = NULL
WHERE started_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 year'
  AND (transcript IS NOT NULL OR transcript_encrypted IS NOT NULL OR transcript_text_encrypted IS NOT NULL OR summary IS NOT NULL OR summary_encrypted IS NOT NULL)
  AND id NOT IN (SELECT resource_id FROM legal_holds WHERE resource_type = 'conversation');

-- Phase 2: Delete full conversation records older than 3 years
DELETE FROM conversations
WHERE started_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '3 years'
  AND id NOT IN (SELECT resource_id FROM legal_holds WHERE resource_type = 'conversation');

-- Purge memories older than 2 years
DELETE FROM memories
WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '2 years'
  AND id NOT IN (SELECT resource_id FROM legal_holds WHERE resource_type = 'memory');

-- Purge call analyses older than 1 year
DELETE FROM call_analyses
WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 year'
  AND id NOT IN (SELECT resource_id FROM legal_holds WHERE resource_type = 'call_analysis');

-- Purge daily call context older than 90 days
DELETE FROM daily_call_context
WHERE call_date < NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days';

-- Purge reminder deliveries older than 90 days
DELETE FROM reminder_deliveries
WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days';

-- Purge notifications older than 180 days
DELETE FROM notifications
WHERE sent_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '180 days';

-- Purge waitlist signups older than 1 year
DELETE FROM waitlist
WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 year';

-- Purge audit logs older than 6 years
DELETE FROM audit_logs
WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '6 years';
```

### Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Create `legal_holds` table for litigation hold exemptions
- [ ] Implement purge job as a scheduled task (cron or application scheduler)
- [ ] Add dry-run mode (log what would be purged without executing)
- [ ] Add batch processing (process 1000 records at a time to avoid long locks)
- [ ] Log purge actions to audit log (counts per table, not content)
- [ ] Alert if purge job fails or does not run within expected window
- [ ] Test purge job on dev/staging environments with production data copies
- [ ] Add purge job to monitoring dashboard

## Legal Hold Procedures

A **legal hold** (also called litigation hold) suspends normal data destruction when litigation, investigation, or regulatory action is anticipated or ongoing.

### When to Initiate a Legal Hold

- Receipt of a litigation notice, subpoena, or government investigation
- Anticipation of litigation (even before formal notice)
- Regulatory audit notification from HHS OCR
- Internal investigation into a potential breach

### How to Implement

1. **HIPAA Security Officer** or **legal counsel** issues a legal hold notice.
2. Create records in the `legal_holds` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE legal_holds (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  resource_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,  -- 'conversation', 'memory', 'senior', etc.
  resource_id UUID NOT NULL,           -- ID of the held record
  hold_reason TEXT NOT NULL,           -- Why the hold was placed
  placed_by VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,     -- Who placed the hold
  placed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  released_at TIMESTAMP,              -- NULL = still active
  released_by VARCHAR(255)
);
```

3. All automated purge jobs check for active legal holds before deleting.
4. Manual deletion requests are also blocked for held records.

### Releasing a Legal Hold

- Only **legal counsel** or **HIPAA Security Officer** can release a legal hold.
- Document the release reason and date.
- Records resume normal retention schedule from the release date (not from their original creation date).

## Data Subject Rights

Under HIPAA (and potentially state privacy laws like CCPA), individuals have rights regarding their PHI:

### Right to Access (45 CFR 164.524)

- Individuals (seniors and caregivers) have the right to request access to their PHI.
- Donna must provide the requested PHI within **30 days** (one 30-day extension permitted).
- PHI must be provided in the format requested by the individual if readily producible.
- A reasonable, cost-based fee may be charged.

**Implementation**: Build an admin tool or API endpoint that exports all PHI for a given senior in a machine-readable format (JSON or CSV).

### Right to Amendment (45 CFR 164.526)

- Individuals have the right to request amendment of their PHI if they believe it is incorrect or incomplete.
- Donna must act on the request within **60 days** (one 30-day extension permitted).
- Amendments may be denied if the PHI is accurate, was not created by Donna, or is not available for access.

**Implementation**: Admin dashboard should support editing senior profiles, memories, and medical notes with audit logging of all changes.

### Right to an Accounting of Disclosures (45 CFR 164.528)

- Individuals have the right to know who has accessed their PHI in the past **6 years**.
- Exceptions: disclosures for treatment, payment, healthcare operations, and certain other purposes.

**Implementation**: The audit log (once implemented) must track all disclosures of PHI, including to vendors (via API calls), to caregivers (via notifications), and to admin users (via dashboard access).

### Right to Request Restrictions (45 CFR 164.522)

- Individuals can request restrictions on how their PHI is used or disclosed.
- Donna is not required to agree to restrictions, except when disclosure is to a health plan for payment purposes (not applicable to Donna).

### Right to Request Confidential Communications

- Individuals can request that Donna communicate with them in a certain way (e.g., only at a specific phone number).

**Implementation**: The existing `preferred_call_times` and per-senior `call_settings` partially address this. Extend to support additional communication preferences.

## Deletion Request Process

When a caregiver or senior requests deletion of their data:

### Step 1: Verify Identity

- Confirm the requestor's identity (caregiver via Clerk session, senior via phone verification with admin assistance).
- Confirm the requestor has authority over the data (caregiver must be linked to the senior in the `caregivers` table).

### Step 2: Check for Legal Holds

- Query `legal_holds` for any active holds on the senior's data.
- If a legal hold exists, inform the requestor that deletion is temporarily suspended and provide the reason (without disclosing confidential investigation details).

### Step 3: Execute Deletion

1. **Export data first** (for the requestor if requested, and for compliance records).
2. Delete in this order (respecting foreign key constraints):
   - `daily_call_context` (by senior_id)
   - `reminder_deliveries` (by reminder_id, where reminder.senior_id matches)
   - `reminders` (by senior_id)
   - `call_analyses` (by senior_id)
   - `notifications` (by senior_id)
   - `memories` (by senior_id)
   - `conversations` (by senior_id)
   - `notification_preferences` (by caregiver_id, for linked caregivers)
   - `caregivers` (by senior_id)
   - `seniors` (the profile itself)
3. Log the deletion action to the audit log (record THAT a deletion occurred, not the deleted content).

### Step 4: Vendor Data Deletion

- Request deletion from third-party vendors where Donna has sent the senior's data (per BAA terms).
- This is difficult to enforce without BAAs -- another reason BAAs are critical.
- At minimum, document which vendors received the senior's data and when deletion was requested.

### Step 5: Confirm Deletion

- Notify the requestor that deletion is complete.
- Retain the audit log entry documenting the deletion (this is retained for 6 years per HIPAA).
- **Timeline**: Complete deletion within **30 days** of receiving the verified request.

## Third-Party Vendor Data Retention

Donna sends PHI to multiple vendors. Each vendor's data retention policy must be understood and documented.

| Vendor | Data Sent | Vendor Retention Policy | Action Needed |
|--------|-----------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Anthropic** | Conversation messages | 30-day default; opt out of training | Confirm via BAA; opt out of data retention for training |
| **Google (Gemini)** | Transcripts for analysis | Varies by API (typically no retention for API calls with data processing agreement) | Confirm via GCP data processing terms |
| **Deepgram** | Audio stream | Streaming (not retained); confirm no log retention | Confirm via BAA |
| **ElevenLabs** | TTS text input | Check vendor policy | Confirm via BAA or vendor inquiry |
| **Cartesia** | TTS text input | Check vendor policy | Confirm via BAA or vendor inquiry |
| **Groq** | Conversation turns | Check vendor policy | Confirm via vendor inquiry/BAA |
| **Cerebras** | Legacy/not active; conversation turns only if re-enabled | Check vendor policy before any re-enable | Keep disabled/remove stale env references unless BAA is signed |
| **OpenAI** | Memory text, search queries | API: not used for training (opt-out); check retention | Confirm via BAA |
| **Tavily** | Search queries | Check vendor policy | Confirm via vendor inquiry |
| **Twilio** | Audio, phone numbers, SMS | Configurable; default varies | Configure retention limits in Twilio console; confirm via BAA |
| **Neon** | All database data | Customer-controlled (PITR 7 days on Pro) | Managed by this retention policy |
| **Sentry** | Error traces | 90 days default; configurable | Set appropriate retention in Sentry settings |
| **Railway** | Application logs | 7 days default | Acceptable; export incident-relevant logs before expiry |

**Action**: For each vendor, confirm retention policies as part of BAA negotiation. Include data deletion/return provisions in all BAAs.

---

## Annual Review

This policy must be reviewed annually and updated when:

1. **Regulatory changes**: New HIPAA guidance, state law changes, or FTC enforcement actions that affect retention requirements.
2. **Business changes**: New data types collected, new vendors added, new features that generate PHI.
3. **Incident findings**: Post-incident reviews may reveal that retention periods need adjustment.
4. **Legal review**: Annual legal review of retention periods against applicable state and federal requirements.

### Review Checklist
