As of April 22, 2026, the active live-call stack is Telnyx Call Control/media streams with L16/16k audio, Deepgram Nova 3 STT, Claude Haiku 4.5 for conversation, Groq Director with Gemini fallback, ElevenLabs Flash TTS, Gemini post-call analysis, and email/in-app caregiver notifications. SMS and Twilio voice are inactive.
